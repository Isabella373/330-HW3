    "- **Age**: The <=50K group has a strong peak around age 20-25, indicating many younger workers earn less. In contrast, the >50K group shows a broader distribution with peak frequencies around ages 35-50, suggesting middle-aged individuals are more likely to have higher incomes. Both distributions taper off after age 60, with very few high earners beyond 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capital.gain**: Using log scale reveals that the vast majority of individuals (approximately 10,000 in both groups) report zero capital gains. However, among those with non-zero capital gains, the >50K group shows substantially more occurrences across all gain levels, particularly at the highest gain value (~100,000), where >50K earners dominate. This suggests capital gains are a strong discriminating feature for income prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capital.loss**: Similar to capital.gain, most individuals (around 10,000) report zero capital losses. The log scale shows that the >50K group has more instances of capital losses in the 1,500-2,500 range, while both groups have comparable frequencies for smaller losses. This feature may be less discriminative than capital.gain but still provides useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Education.num**: This feature shows the strongest separation between income groups. The <=50K distribution peaks sharply at education level 9 and 10, with over 3,500 individuals. The >50K distribution shows high frequencies at levels 13 with ~900 individuals and levels 9-10 with ~650 individuals, indicating higher education correlates with higher income.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fnlwgt (final weight)**: Both income groups display nearly identical bell-shaped distributions centered around 200,000, with the <=50K group showing slightly higher frequencies across all weight ranges. The similarity of these distributions suggests this feature provides minimal discriminative power for income classification and may not be useful for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hours.per.week**: Both groups show a dramatic spike at 40 hours per week, with approximately 5,000 individuals in the <=50K group and 1,300 in the >50K group working standard full-time hours. The >50K group shows relatively higher proportions at 45-60 hours per week, suggesting longer work hours may be associated with higher income. The <=50K group has more representation at part-time hours (under 40), indicating part-time work is more common among lower earners."

We need imputation to handle missing values because most models and encoders cannot handle missing categories directly, followed by one-hot encoding to convert categories into numerical format suitable for ML models. Moreover, One-hot encoding is applied because the categories have no natural ordering, and one-hot encoding avoids introducing artificial ordinal relationships while allowing the model to learn separate effects for each category.\n",

It reflects how the record should be weighted to represent the population, rather than a meaningful “feature” about the person. The histograms show nearly identical distributions across income groups, suggesting it has minimal predictive power and should be dropped.\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | This feature represents educational attainment levels with a natural ordering (e.g, high school < college < bachelor < graduate degree) Ordinal encoding preserves this hierarchical relationship, which is more appropriate than one-hot encoding that would treat education levels as unrelated categories.\n",

One-hot encoding is appropriate to represent each category as a separate binary feature. It prevents imposing an artificial order and allows the model to learn separate effects for each marital status category.\n",

The categories do not have a natural order, so one-hot encoding is suitable. This representation enables the model to capture different impacts of relationship types on the target without forcing an artificial numerical scale.\n",

    "| capital.gain | scaling with `StandardScaler` |   A numeric feature with a wide range (0 to ~100,000) and heavy skew toward zero. Scaling helps models that are sensitive to magnitude and distance computations (linear models, SVM, kNN) and improves numerical stability during optimization. StandardScaler standardizes the feature so it does not dominate other numeric inputs purely due to scale.\n",

    "1. Calling fit_transform on the test data causes data leakage, because the scaler would compute statistics (mean and variance) using information from the test set. This makes the evaluation unrealistically optimistic. The correct approach is to fit the scaler on the training data and only transform the test data.\n",
    "2. The Golden Rule ensures that no information from the test set is used during training or preprocessing, which preserves a fair evaluation. Violating it does not necessarily give a worse classifier, but it leads to overly optimistic performance estimates that do not reflect real-world generalization.\n",
    "3. First, pipelines help prevent data leakage by ensuring that preprocessing steps are applied consistently during training and testing. Second, they make workflows more modular, readable, and easier to use with tools like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "4. A ColumnTransformer is appropriate when different subsets of features require different preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling numeric features, encoding categorical features). It allows these transformations to be applied in parallel within a single, unified preprocessing object.\n"
